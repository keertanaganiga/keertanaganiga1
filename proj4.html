					<p>e-Yantra Lab Setup Initiative (eLSI) is a college level program under which colleges are encouraged to setup robotics labs. AIET is privileged to be a part of this initiative since 2013. Our college has conducted a workshop on robotics to students for the consecutive two years. This workshop has helped our students in knowing the basics and programming a robotic kit</p>
					<p>e-Yantra Robotics Competition (eYRC) is a unique annual competition for undergraduate students in science and engineering colleges. Selected teams are given a robotic kit complete with accessories and video tutorials to help them learn basic concepts in embedded systems and microcontroller programming. Abstracts of real world problems assigned as "themes" are then implemented by the teams using the robotic kits. The winners of this competition will get a cash prize and offered summer internship at IITB through e-Yantra Summer Internship Program.

                    <p>Today we are living in 21st century. It is important to control
the home from want area. Home computerization is the
control of any electrically and gadgets gadget in our home and
office, regardless of whether we are there or away. There are
many items accessible that enable us to control over the
gadgets naturally with utilizing Arduino microcontroller
display either by remote control or even by website page or by
portable application. This Home computerization framework
give the client remote control and observing of different
apparatuses inside their home. Productive administration of
power at home computerization utilizing Arduino is the way
to the present patterns being taken after to change them into a
superior, speedier and solid mechanical arrangements or
frameworks. Mechanization alludes to strategy of influencing
frameworks to control them with a view to diminish human
exertion. With this rule came the possibility of our task
”Remote control of Home machines utilizing Automation
System”.</p>
                    <p>The proposed venture controls electrical apparatuses
and segments at home to be consequently or remotely
controlled by Arduino and android application. The
foundation of this framework is the Arduino microcontroller
and Wireless Internet which gives the interface between the
client and the apparatuses. Through web client can get to or
work any associated gadget from anyplace and framework
likewise checks for any gadget left exchanged on by client to
turn it off. With the utilization of different sensors whole
association is built up amongst Internet and the gadget
utilizing wifi. This gadget is intended to be ease and to control
assortment of gadgets .Home computerization advantages will
be center around how this can be accomplished through
utilization of Arduino, physical switch, webpage and
advanced mobile phone</p>
