					<h2>RARE BLOOD TRACKER ANDROID APPLICATION</h2>
					<p>There are lots of factors to be considered while taking the blood from any donor using an
application. Personal information, last donation date and any reaction occurred, etc. all
have to be stored. These stored information is possible to access with the different
techniques of data mining like classification, clustering, prediction, association, etc which
gives the segments of potential blood donors in terms of identifiable characteristics,
behaviour patterns, and it also suggest properly at the time of blood requirement in urgent
cases.
</p>
					<p>There is communication gap between patients, donors, blood banks and hospitals that
need blood in case of an emergency. Medical facility is not available equally in every part
of the country. If someone needs blood, first of all he searches it within his family
members, then nearest hospitals and blood banks. If they cannot manage blood in these
ways, it is really hard for them to contact other people to collect blood in a short time. </p>
                    <p>This project plays an important role in saving lives, which is its main aim. The Rare
Blood Tracker is developed to help people to find the nearest blood bank to which they
can donate the blood and request the blood from. Application consists of a login and
register page for users as well as for blood banks which helps them to register and login
in with the application. All the necessary details of users is entered at the time of
registration which can later be updated. In case of emergencies, rather than searching for
a donor application searches for the blood bank with available blood group. This is
considered as a reliable method compared to directly contacting a donor without any
medical information. This application not only connects the user and blood banks, but
also acts as a bridge between blood banks in case of unavailability of rare blood types.
The main aim of developing this application is to reduce the search and increase the
availability of rare blood types</p>
