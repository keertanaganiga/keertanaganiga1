					<h2>AN ANDROID APP FOR TRAFFIC PRE-EMPTION USING
VANET</h2>
					<p>Nowadays road accidents, traffic congestion and road hazards
are the main traffic problem that are facing today. According to
the survey made, India was listed under top 10 countries were
maximum road accidents are taking place. To overcome,
VANET can play a major role. The project is focusing on an
android app, a database server and the hardware equipment’s.
Using the app, the user can know the traffic congestion prior, if
in case accident occurred then the hardware equipment’s report
to the main server automatically with the help of GPS module,
so that the web server can forward that message to authorized
person. The app can also help with the route direction, weather
forecasting and also it can warn the driver if there is a chance
of accident due to the speed of the vehicle or any such
symptoms. The Project can save many lives. It can detect the
unaware accidents and the app can save their lives. </p>
					<p>The project's objective is to develop a system that can
facilitate reporting and hence alerting the drivers about things
happening in their surrounding region thereby extending the
range of emergency warnings. It also describes a traffic
signaling method to complement the existing traffic signaling
for pre-empting the traffic lights in case of emergency. Other
drivers can be warned earlier and are provided with detailed
information about the route of the approaching emergency
vehicle. This enables them to react timely and appropriately so
that they do not block the emergency vehicle. Also a pedestrian
carrying a Smartphone installed with Android App app can
report about road accidents, hazards and congestion that come
across his journey directly to the authority on click of a button
and avail emergency service to the injured without involving
into its legal side. In case if the user is driving, facilities are
provided such that the OBU kept inside the vehicle detects the
accident automatically and reports it to the authority</p>
                    <p>Results have shown that the application developed is able to
correctly fulfill its purpose within a short time period, opening
new research opportunities for the integration of smartphones
and vehicular networks.</p>
